# How to Choose Perfect Wedding Table Numbers

Table numbers might seem like a small detail, but they play a crucial role in your wedding reception. They help guests find their seats quickly, add to your table décor, and create beautiful photo opportunities.

## Why Table Numbers Matter

Many couples underestimate the importance of table numbers. Here's what they do:

- **Guide guests** to their designated seats efficiently
- **Enhance table décor** with coordinated design
- **Prevent confusion** especially at large weddings
- **Create visual interest** across your reception space

Wedding planners report that clear table numbers reduce guest questions about seating by 60%.

## How to Choose the Right Style

### Consider Your Wedding Theme

|-------|------------------------|
| Modern/Minimalist | Acrylic, gold numbers |
| Rustic | Wood, kraft paper |
| Glamour | Mirror, sequin accents |
| Garden | Floral, greenery accents |
| Vintage | Calligraphy, antique finish |

### Match Your Color Palette

Your table numbers should complement—not compete with—your centerpieces. Consider:

- **Neutral weddings**: Gold, silver, or rose gold numbers work with any palette
- **Bold color weddings**: Match numbers to accent colors
- **Pastel weddings**: Blush pink, mint, or lavender tints

## Creative Table Number Ideas

### Go Beyond Numbers

Some couples prefer creative alternatives:

1. **Table names instead of numbers**: Use meaningful names (cities you've traveled, favorite movies, song titles)
2. **Photos**: Each table named after a memorable moment
3. **Quotes**: Love quotes for each table
4. **Destination**: Tables named after places special to you as a couple

## Ordering Tips

When ordering custom table numbers:

1. **Confirm final guest count** before ordering
2. **Number of tables** = guest count ÷ table capacity (usually 8-10)
3. **Order 2-3 extra** in case of damage
4. **Ask about bulk discounts** for larger orders
